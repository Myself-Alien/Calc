<h2>GTK-4 Calculator (C)</h2>
A simple desktop calculator application built using GTK-4 and C, designed to demonstrate modern GTK-4 UI concepts such as grid layouts, signal handling, CSS styling, and application lifecycle management.
This project was created as a learning-oriented implementation, focusing on correct GTK-4 practices rather than legacy GTK-3 patterns.

<h3>Features</h3>
GTK-4 based graphical user interface
Grid-based calculator layout
Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
Expression-style input (e.g. 2 + 2 = 4)
Custom CSS styling using GtkCssProvider
Clean separation between UI logic and styling
Minimal, dependency-free C code (no external frameworks)

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
C (C17 compatible)
GTK-4
GObject / GLib
CSS (GTK-4 styling system)
